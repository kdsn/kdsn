 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Keld's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I embarked on my coding journey not as a traditional computer science student, but as an IT support specialist who felt the need for a centralized repository of guides and tools. This necessity led me to create "isp-ninja.dk," a toolkit designed specifically for IT support professionals, now dead. Diving into coding was a natural progression, driven by the need to streamline and enhance my professional toolkit.

My exploration into the programming world was anchored in PHP, practical tools that aligned well with my goal of creating accessible and efficient online platforms. Though I pursued an education as a computer technician with a specialization in programming, my career path veered towards entrepreneurship. I primarily worked for myself, focusing on developing WordPress websites and catering to niche needs within the digital space.

Among the multitude of projects I've envisioned, the latest is a service aimed at helping restaurants secure more and better reviews on platforms like Google and Facebook. This initiative reflects my broader ambition to leverage technology for practical, real-world applications.

Looking ahead, my goal is to develop Software as a Service (SaaS) projects. These endeavors will likely run parallel to my main line of work, which continues to orbit around web development and digital marketing. The journey from an IT support role to an independent web developer and entrepreneur has been filled with learning and adaptation. 

As I venture further into the realm of SaaS, I recognize the importance of balancing this ambition with my existing commitments. The drive to create, to turn ideas into tangible solutions, remains my guiding force. And while the comfort of established routines is tempting, I am once again ready to embrace the discomfort of the unknown ‚Äî to innovate, to create, and to make a mark in the digital world.
